# RoleplayingVoiceCore
Turn your own in game dialogue into a fun roleplaying voice!

This is the Core for interacting with Elevenlabs and "possibly" other AI voice generators down the line.
Responsible for allowing sending/receiving/and playback of player audio via a seperately hosted server.

For an example of how Roleplaying Voice Core is used see how its implemented for Dalamud, a Final Fantasy XIV plugin ecosystem:

This core could in theory be used for other games if implemented correctly.
